## A personal note on creating a compelling game

What follows is more of a philosophical peek into my thoughts on why I decided
against achievements and other decorative tactics employed in game design.

### Options for decorating a mechanic

There seems to be many ways to make a simple game more compelling.  You can
supplement it with an interesting narrative, engage the senses more with
audiovisual embellishments, add another complementary game mechanic, add more
concrete numbers/awards to focus compulsions of self-improvement, etc.

My preferences lead me to try to engage the player in intrinsic ways.  1) I
like narratives and stories that enrich the gameplay, but our game has none.
2) I believe our game's audiovisual elements help to trigger positive emotions
in the player.  3) I find its core mechanic to be interesting enough and
mentally exercising. 4) There is a high score system that allows the player to
measure how well they have done.

### On achievements

There are no concrete awards or achievement recognitions in the game.

I think it's a cool thing for players to come up with fun goals that are
secondary to the game's own simple objectives.  I think that's an organic thing
that happens on the player side-- wanting to grow the game with their own
creative elements.

I think the game industry internalized this idea and sought to provide players
with secondary objectives and accompanying awards.  If we are to measure actions
by their intentions rather than their effects, then this would be fine, presuming
innocent intentions.

But I think installing a mechanism for promoting award-chasing has had the
effect of significantly increasing the compulsive power of an already powerful
medium of video gaming.  I think this power has the potential to take the
player's sense of production and creativity and turn it into one of compulsive
participation.

I would never look at a piece of art as a "carrot and stick approach" that is
tricking me into feeling certain emotions.  To me, art is something that 1) shows
me a message from its author 2) is wrapped in a style that creates the right
emotion for its message, and 3) causes me to meet it halfway with my interpretation
by relating my own experiences.
