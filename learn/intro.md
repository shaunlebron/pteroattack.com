# Intro

Hello, I'm Shaun.  I built all of the tech for this game from scratch with my
team at [Hygoon](http://hygoon.com) during the great year of 2013!

This "Devpendium" is composed of multiple sections that describe and illustrate
many of the aspects of how we developed Pterodactyl Attack.  There are many
pictures, animations, and even some videos.

_This does not flow like a book!  I encourage you to click around and look at
the pictures until you find something that grabs your attention enough to read
about its context._

This guide is roughly split into three categories:

- DESIGN: high-level design of gameplay and other elements
- TECH: low-level details about the noticeable aspects of the game
- MISC: more low-level details about _unseen_ technical aspects of the game

Enjoy!
