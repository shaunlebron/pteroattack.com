# Preface

_... on why I wrote this_

I wish it were easy to take apart and study a video game.  Imagine if your
favorite Mario game came with a manual about how they built it.  This is
the world I'd like to see and the reason for my writing.

Unfortunately, video games are not like those simple alarm clocks with gears
and switches that kids take apart and learn.  Video games are like
building-sized contraptions that carry a prohibitively daunting amount of
complexity.

So this writing is an experiment to see whether something like this can be done
in a valuable way.  It's a bit larger in scope than a conventional video game
"postmortem".  Rather, it is what I call a “Devpendium”, an effort to guide one
through the machinery of our game and the processes by which we built it.

I hope you find some educational value or are at least inspired by the spirit
of what I'm doing. I'm afraid I've run out of time to work on this any further,
but I hope to write better ones on future projects.

In the meantime, happy reading, writing, and developing!
