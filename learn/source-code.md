# Source Code

For those who don't know, a game's _source code_ is a very large sequence of
instructions that the computer reads to run and display the game.

We will release the source code for Pterodactyl Attack and its tools under a
free software license that will allow you to modify and distribute.  This will
be done some time after our game's sales have petered off, a la [id
Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software#Technology).
